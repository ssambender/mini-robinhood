<i>Note: The intent of this project is not to circumvent any paywall or completely bypass any subscription, and should not be used as such. I already have a NYT subscribscription, though while using incognito browsers the log in doesn't save and requires a new sign in each time, this project aims to make my life a bit easier by addressing the lack of autofill issue with the NYT on incognito. This also helps add the functionaliy of automatically advancing to the next word after a row is completed. Only those who have paid or are allowed access should/can use this client, no exceptions, and will otherwise be in violation of this softwares license.</i>
